# ActionInputs

This repository contains the CSV files used as inputs to the ActionTraction and
WorkKnow Programs. Specifically, these CSV files contain the list of the top 200
most critical projects, across multiple programming languages, as reported by
the [ossf/criticality_score](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score) tool.
Although the aforementioned project provides a
[download](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/ossf-criticality-score/index.html)
of these CSV files, this repository exists so as to support the replication of
experiments conducted with the
[ActionTraction](https://github.com/AnalyzeActions/ActionTraction) and
[WorkKnow](https://github.com/AnalyzeActions/WorkKnow) tools. Please note that
these CSV files were not produced by a tool available in this repository or by a
contributor to this organization. For an updated version of the tool used to
create these CSV files or the most recent version of these files as shared by
the OSSF, please refer to their respective links.
